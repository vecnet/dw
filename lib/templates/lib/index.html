	<p>VecNet was founded in 2011 to address the concerns and recommendations of the Malaria Eradication Research Agenda (malERA) initiative. The initiative, funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, is a collection of 12 reviews highlighting the outcomes of a series of consultations from more than 250 experts on malaria from 36 countries.</p>
<p>The malERA series of consultations concluded that malaria elimination requires a means of accessing and analyzing all relevant data to prolong the effective life of present vector control interventions, whilst also recognizing the need for additional interventions to achieve elimination.</p>
<p>More information on malERA can be found at: <a href="http://www.ploscollections.org/article/browseIssue.action?issue=info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pcol.v07.i13" target="_blank">PLOS Collections: malERA â€“ a research agenda for malaria eradication</a></p>
<p>VecNet is creating an analytic framework that will assemble all known data on malaria transmission and make it accessible through mathematical models in an intuitive and user-friendly manner. This openly shared set of resources will facilitate interactions and communication between scientists to support research activities, surveillance, monitoring, and evaluation of programs and interventions; allow malaria control programs to select the optimal intervention combination for a given geographic area based on vector behaviors; and effectively inform strategic planning and malaria elimination assessments at a range of scales from global policy to local-level planning.</p>

<h3>About the VecNet logo</h3>
<p><img style="margin: 0 10px 0 0; float: left; width: 80px;" src="https://www.vecnet.org/images/vecnet_logo_small.jpg" alt="VecNet logo" width="80">The VecNet logo features a mosquito superimposed on a graph.&nbsp; Specifically, the mosquito is an anopheline (of the genus <em>Anopheles</em>, the only mosquitoes which transmit malaria to humans) shown in its classic feeding position. The downward trending graph represents a reduction in malaria transmission through the work of VecNet and similar organizations.</p>
